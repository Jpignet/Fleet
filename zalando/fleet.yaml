  ### These options control how "fleet apply" downloads the chart
  #
  # A https URL to a Helm repo to download the chart from. It's typically easier
  # to just use `chart` field and refer to a tgz file.  If repo is used the
  # value of `chart` will be used as the chart name to lookup in the Helm repository.
  # is set below this field is the name of the chart to lookup
  chart: postgres-operator
  repo: https://opensource.zalando.com/postgres-operator/charts/postgres-operator
  # The version of the chart or semver constraint of the chart to find. If a constraint
  # is specified it is evaluated each time git changes.
  # The version also determines which chart to download from OCI registries.
  version: 1.10.1

  ### These options only work for helm-type bundles
  #
  # Any values that should be placed in the `values.yaml` and passed to helm during
  # install.
  # Path to any values files that need to be passed to helm during install

  #  - oauth2-proxy-value.yaml

  ### These options control how fleet-agent deploys the bundle, they also apply for kustomize- and manifest-style bundles.
  #
  # A custom release name to deploy the chart as. If not specified a release name
  # will be generated by combining the invoking GitRepo.name + GitRepo.path.
